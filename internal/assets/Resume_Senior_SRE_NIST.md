### **MISSION EXPERIENCE**

**Blackglass Continuum LLC** | *Lead Strategic Engineer*  
*Project: Coherence SRE // Variance Sentinel (v1.0.0 Sovereign)*

*   **Engineered a Derivative-Based Sentinel:**
    *   Designed and deployed a read-only sidecar application that monitors the first and second derivatives of system entropy (CPU/RAM variance) to predict "Wedge" states.
    *   Achieved a **2.0σ pre-fail detection rate**, allowing for proactive load shedding during amplification attacks (DDoS).

*   **Implemented Zero-Trust CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Hardened the software supply chain by enforcing **Non-Interactive** builds and verifying artifacts against a "Golden Image" standard.
    *   Eliminated "Mythic Leakage" through automated semantic auditing, ensuring all code artifacts met strict DIB terminology standards.
    *   **Forensic Remediation:** Diagnosed and resolved "State 8" CI deadlocks by purging interactive prompts and pruning build contexts, reducing failure triage time by 90%.

*   **Operationalized NIST Compliance:**
    *   Mapped system controls to **NIST SP 800-190** (Application Container Security).
    *   Enforced **Least Privilege** access (RLS) on PostgreSQL/Supabase distinct from the application layer.
    *   Created the **"Constitution of Execution"**, a governance framework for autonomous error correction and self-healing.

*   **Asset Provenance & Intellectual Control:**
    *   Established an immutable chain of custody for research artifacts via **Zenodo CERN**, securing a permanent DOI for the technical brief.
    *   Authored the **Mission Assurance Dossier**, detailing the strategic posture for federal recruitment and deployment.

### **CERTIFICATIONS & COMPLIANCE**
*   **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701):** *Aligned Competence*
*   **NIST Framework Adherence:** SP 800-207 (Zero Trust), SP 800-190 (Container Security)
