# BLACKGLASS CONTINUUM QUALITY MANUAL
**Reference:** ISO 9001:2015 Compliance Framework
**Entity:** Blackglass Continuum LLC | **CAGE:** 17TJ5 | **UEI:** SVZVXPTM9AF4
**Version:** 1.0 (Initial Sovereign Release)

---

## 1. SCOPE OF THE QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (QMS)
Blackglass Continuum LLC provides **Reliability Engineering, Observability Architecture, and Predictive Interdiction Services** for mission-critical and defense sectors.
* **Boundaries:** The QMS applies to all SRE operations, software deployment, and forensic analysis conducted by Blackglass Continuum.

## 2. CONTEXT OF THE ORGANIZATION (Clause 4)
**Internal Context:** We operate as a high-availability engineering entity focused on "System 5" cybernetics. Our core asset is the *Variance Horizon Methodology*.
**External Context:** We serve the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and High-Frequency Trading (HFT) sectors, where latency and downtime are existential threats.

## 3. LEADERSHIP (Clause 5)
**Leadership Commitment:** Top management (The Principal Architect) ensures that the Quality Policy is compatible with the strategic direction of **"Aggressive Architecture."** We are committed to replacing reactive firefighting with deterministic prevention.

**Quality Policy:**
> *"Blackglass Continuum is dedicated to the elimination of entropy in client systems. We commit to satisfying applicable requirements (Federal & Commercial) and to the continual improvement of the Variance Horizon Protocol. Our standard is not 'Good Enough'; our standard is 'Physics-Proven'."*

## 4. PLANNING (Clause 6)
* **Risk:** System Drift / Entropy Accumulation.
* **Mitigation:** The **Variance Horizon Protocol**. We do not rely on static thresholds; we monitor the second derivative of variance to predict failure.
* **Risk:** Security Breach.
* **Mitigation:** The **Zero-Write / Read-Only** operational model.

## 5. SUPPORT (Clause 7)
* **Resources:** The Sovereign Reliability Lab (Air-gapped simulation environment).
* **Documented Information:** All operational logic is version-controlled. The repository is the single source of truth (SSOT). All forensic logs are retained per DoD retention schedules.

## 6. OPERATION (Clause 8)
**Operational Planning:** We execute services using the **Forensic Evidence Lifecycle**:
1. **Signal Acquisition:** Read-only telemetry taps.
2. **Variance Analysis:** Algorithmic drift detection.
3. **Interdiction:** Automated or Sovereign intervention to restore coherence.

**Nonconforming Outputs:** If a deployment fails the **Coherence Threshold** (Variance Acceleration > Limit), it is immediately rejected.

## 7. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (Clause 9)
**KPIs:** "False Positive Rate" of the Variance Detector and "Time to Interdiction".
**Review:** The Principal Architect reviews the QMS quarterly.

## 8. IMPROVEMENT (Clause 10)
**Corrective Action:** Root Cause Analysis (RCA) -> Repository Update -> Doctrine Revision.
